# VOTING# AI Voting Advisor - Solidity Smart Contract

## Overview
The **AI Voting Advisor** is a Solidity smart contract that provides automated voting recommendations for proposals. Based on a proposal ID, the contract suggests whether to approve or reject it, offers a detailed recommendation, and provides reasoning.

## Features
- **Basic Recommendation:** Determines if a proposal should be approved or rejected based on its ID.
- **Detailed Recommendation:** Offers a more nuanced decision with different levels of support.
- **Recommendation Reasoning:** Explains the rationale behind the decision.

## Functions
### `getVotingRecommendation(uint256 proposalId) -> string`
Returns "Approve" if the proposal ID is even, otherwise returns "Reject."

### `getDetailedRecommendation(uint256 proposalId) -> string`
Provides a detailed recommendation such as "Strongly Approve," "Neutral," or "Strongly Reject" based on the proposal ID.

### `getRecommendationReason(uint256 proposalId) -> string`
Explains the reason for the recommendation, considering factors like decentralization, risk, and sustainability.

## How to Use
1. Deploy the contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
2. Call the provided functions with a `proposalId` to receive AI-based voting advice.

## Notes
- The contract does not require any imports or constructors.
- It operates on pure functions, making it gas-efficient.
